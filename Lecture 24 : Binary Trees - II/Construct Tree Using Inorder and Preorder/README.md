# Construct Tree Using Inorder and Preorder




For a given preorder and inorder traversal of a Binary Tree of type integer stored in an array/list, create the binary tree using the given two arrays/lists. You just need to construct the tree and return the root.            

Note:         
Assume that the Binary Tree contains only unique elements.             

Input Format:            
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the size of the list/array. It can also be said that N is the total number of nodes the binary tree would have.           
The second line of input contains N integers, all separated by a single space. It represents the preorder-traversal of the binary tree.            
The third line of input contains N integers, all separated by a single space. It represents the inorder-traversal of the binary tree.               

Output Format:         
The given input tree will be printed in a level order fashion where each level will be printed on a new line.              
Elements on every level will be printed in a linear fashion. A single space will separate them.               

Constraints:             
1 <= N <= 10^4            
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.               
Time Limit: 1 sec
