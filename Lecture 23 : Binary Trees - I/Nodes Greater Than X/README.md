# Nodes Greater Than X




For a given a binary tree of integers and an integer X, find and return the total number of nodes of the given binary tree which are having data greater than X.         

Input Format:            
The first line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.            
The second line of input contains an integer, denoting the value of X.            

Note:          
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.       

Output Format:            
The only line of output prints the total number of nodes where the node data is greater than X.            

Constraints:            
1 <= N <= 10^5            
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.           
Time Limit: 1 sec             

Sample Input 1:           
1 4 2 3 -1 -1 -1           
2                     
Sample Output 1:            
2              
Explanation for Sample Input 1:             
Out of the four nodes of the given binary tree, [3, 4] are the node data that are greater than X = 2.             

Sample Input 2:                   
5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1         
5                  
Sample Output 2:           
3
