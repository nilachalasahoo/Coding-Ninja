# Print Tree Level-wise




Given a generic tree, print the input tree in level wise order. That is, print the elements at same level in one line (separated by space). Print different levels in different lines.              

The output for the above tree should be           
10            
20 30 40             
40 50

Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is -             
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element
