# Check if generic tree contain element x




Given a generic tree and an integer x, check if x is present in the given tree or not. Return true if x is present, return false otherwise.           

Input format :            
Line 1 : Integer x         
Line 2 : Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is -                   
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element           

Output format : true or false            

Sample Input 1 :             
40

Sample Output 1 :              
true              
Explanation :           
Since, 40 is present in the given tree, so the answer will be true.      

Sample Input 2 :            
4             
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0                
Sample Output 2:
