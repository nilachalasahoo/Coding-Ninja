# Next larger element




Given a generic tree and an integer n. Find and return the node with next larger element in the Tree i.e. find a node with value just greater than n.               
Return NULL if no node is present with value greater than n.             

Input format :                
Line 1 : Integer n          
Line 2 : Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class) in the given below order             
node_data, n(number of children of node), n children, and so on for every element              

Output format :            
Node with value just greater than n.

Sample Output 1 :             
20                
Explanation :            
In the given tree, the value which is just greater than 18 is 20.
