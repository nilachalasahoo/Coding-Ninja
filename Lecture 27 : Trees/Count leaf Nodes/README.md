# Count leaf Nodes




Given a generic tree, count and return the number of leaf nodes present in the given tree. A node is said to be a leaf node if it's not having any child             
Leaf nodes in the given tree are 40, 50, 30, 40. So the answer for this is 4.                     

Input format :           
Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is -             
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element            

Output Format :            
Count of leaf nodes
