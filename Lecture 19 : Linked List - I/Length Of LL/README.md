# Length Of LL




Given the head of a singly linked list of integers, find and return its length.       

Example:          
Sample Linked List          
The length of the list is 4. Hence we return 4.        

Note:          
Exercise caution when dealing with edge cases, such as when the head is NULL. Failing to handle these edge cases appropriately may result in a runtime error in your code.         

Input format :           
The first and only line contains elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.       

Output format :     
Return a single integer denoting the length of the linked list.           

Sample Input 1 :         
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1       
Sample Output 1 :         
7         
Explanation of sample input 1 :       
The number of nodes in the given linked list is 7.          
Hence we return 7.        

Sample Input 2 :      
10 76 39 -3 2 9 -23 9 -1       
Sample Output 2 :      
8           

Expected Time Complexity:       
Try to do this in O(n).       

Constraints :      
0 <= N <= 10^5      
Time Limit: 1 sec
