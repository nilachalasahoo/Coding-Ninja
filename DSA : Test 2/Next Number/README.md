# Next Number




Given a large number represented in the form of a linked list. Write code to increment the number by 1 in-place(i.e. without using extra space).              
Note: You don't need to print the elements, just update the elements and return the head of updated LL.          

Input Constraints:                  
1 <= Length of Linked List <=10^6.          

Input format :        
Line 1 : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)         

Output Format :         
Line 1: Updated linked list elements           

Sample Input 1 :          
3 9 2 5 -1             
Sample Output 1 :            
3 9 2 6           

Sample Input 2 :         
9 9 9 -1          
Sample Output 1 :
